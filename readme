I was intrigued by the question of which presidents had turned in the best (or worst) stock market performance. The Dow Jones Industrial index was first calculated on May 26, 1986, making it the second oldest stock market index (the Dow Jones Transportation index is the oldest). Although one could argue that there are many problems with the way the Dow is calculated, it's the best proxy could find with a verfiable history.
